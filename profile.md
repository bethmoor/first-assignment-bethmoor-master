# Who am I?
   I'm Beth, I'm 22 from the UK. I chose to study with CodeOp after finding out about their inclusivity and women-only approach to progressing into tech.

## My background and interest in coding
    I am currently a nursery practitioner but have always had a love for technology. I began 3D modelling from 14 as a hobby using programs such as Blender and Zbrush which then led me to the world of programming. I studied at college for a while after teaching myself some of the basic fundamentals, I quickly felt after meeting with my lecturers and peers that I didn't fit in and that the course material and how I was being taught was a little outdated.

### Facts about me
- I am one of 7 sisters with 6 nieces and nephews already whom I adore!
- I love cats and have a Ragdoll named Rex.
- I hope to become a Software Developer.
